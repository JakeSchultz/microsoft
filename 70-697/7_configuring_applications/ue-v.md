## Configuring User Experience Virtualization (UE-V)

UE-V is a virtualization platform that allows users to move from one Windows
system to another but they get to keep the same Windows OS and all of their
settings

UE-V uses XML templates that allow users to save their OS and settings

UE-V provides the following benefits:

+ Administrators have the ability to specify exactly which application and
  desktop settings synchronize between the OS
+ Administrators have the ability to create their own custom templates for
  third-party applications
+ Users have the ability to recover their settings and applications after any
  type of hardware changes
+ Users can access their settings from any location and on any Windows device

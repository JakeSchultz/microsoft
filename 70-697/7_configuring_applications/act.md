## Using the Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT)

Use ACT to do the following:

+ Verify that all of the corporate applications and computer hardware are
  compatible with Windows 10
+ Test the corporate applications for User Account Control (UAC)-related issues
+ Test the corporate web applications and websites for compatibility with new
  versions and security updates to Windows Internet Explorer

After installing ACT, there are three phases of how ACT works within the network

__Phase 1: _Collecting Your Compatibilty Data___

Collecting all compatibilty data from the software packages as well as creating
and configuring your data-collection packages (DCPs)

__Phase 2: _Analyzing Your Compatibilty Data___

Analyzes the information that you collected in Phase 1

__Phase 3: _Testing and Mitigating Your Compatibility Issues___

Consists of testing guidance and procedures for using the development tools.
These tools include the Standard User Analyzer (SUA), the Internet Explorer
Compatibility Test Tool (IECTT), and the Compatibility Administrator, which
allow administrators to fix their compatibilty issues

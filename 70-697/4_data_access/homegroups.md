## Joining and Sharing HomeGroups in Windows 10

Simplifies sharing of music, pictures, and documents within small office or home
network

Share USB connected printers. If you have a printer shared by HomeGroup, it is
automatically installed onto the other HomeGroup-enabled Windows 10 PCs.

Domain-joined computers cannot host a HomeGroup, but they can be a participant
of a HomeGroup.

All editions of Windows 10 can use HomeGroups, but only Home, Enterprise, or
Professional editon can create a HomeGroup.

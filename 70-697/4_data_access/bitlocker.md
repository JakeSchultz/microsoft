## Using BitLcoker Drive Encryption

BitLocker allows you to configure security for mobile devices by locking the
physical drives.

Only 10 Enterprise, Pro, and Education, 8, 7 Pro and Enterprise, 2008/R2,
2012/R2 include BitLocker Drive Encryption, and only th eOS drive or internal
hard drvices can be encrypted with BitLocker.

Files on other types of drives must be encrypted using BitLocker To Go.

BitLocker uses a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 1.2 or higher to store
the security startup key.

A TPM is a chip that is found in newer computers.

BitLocker requires that you have a hard disk with at least two partitions, both
formatted with NTFS.

## Understanding Dynamic Access Control (DAC)

DAC allows you to identify data by using data classifications (both automatic
and manual) and hten control access to these files based on these
classifications.

DAC also gives administrators the ability to control file access by using a
central access policy.

The central access policy will also allow an administrator to setup audit access
to files for reporting and forensic investigation.

DAC allows an administrator to setup Active Directory Rights Management Service
(AD RMS) encryption for Office documents.

Administrators have the ability to give users access to files and folders based
on Active Directory attributes.

## Managing Data Compression

+ Files and folders are managed independently, which means that a compressed
  folder can contain uncompressed files
+ Access to compressed files by applications is transparent
+ Data compression is available only on NTFS partitions. If you copy or move a
  compressed file to a FAT32 partition, Windows 10 automatically uncompresses
  the file.
+ Certain system files (Pagefile.sys) can't be compressed.

## Advantages of Unattended Installation

+ Unattended installation saves time and money because users do not ahve to
  interactively respond to each installation query.
+ It can be configured to provide automated query response while still
  selectively allowing users to provide specified input during installation.
+ It can be used to install clean copies of Windows 10 or upgrade an existing
  operation system (providing it is on th elist of permitted operating systems)
  to Windows 10.
+ It can be expanded to include installation instructions for applications,
  additional language support, service packs, and device drivers.
+ The physical media for Windows 10 does not need to be distributed to all
  computers on which it will be installed.

## Disadvantages of Unattended Installation

+ They require more initial setup than a standard installation of Windows 10.
+ Someone must have access to each client computer and must initiate the
  unattended installation process on the client side.

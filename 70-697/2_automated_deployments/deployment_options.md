You can automate the installation of Windows 10 in several ways. You can install
by using an unattended installation, by using Windows Deployment Services (WDS),
to remotely deploy unattended installations (which requires a Windows Server
2012 R2 machine), by using Hyper-V, or by using the System Preparation Tool for
disk imaging. To help customize these options for qutomating remote
installations, you can also use answer files to provide answers to the questions
that are normally asked during the installation process. After you've installed
Windows 10, you can also automate the installation of applications by using
Windows Installer packages.

The options for automated deployment of Windows 10 are as follows:

+ Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) 2013 Update 1
+ Unattended installation, or unattended setup, which uses _Setup.exe_
+ WDS, which requires Windows SErver 2012 R2 for deployment
+ Windows 10 Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK), which also includes the System
  Preparation Tool (_Sysprep.exe_), used to create images or clones
+ Windows Imageing and Configuration Designer (Windows ICD)
